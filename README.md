Open Weather API Weather App

This web app shows you the weather based on the city you enter. It pulls from the Open Weather API to get hourly data for each location.

I used HTML to lay out the framework of the web page. JavaScript is used to make the fade in for the displayed content upon searching, functionality for both the submit button and the ability to use the enter key to submit and not just the submit button, the API call as well as the function to display all the data and have changing backgrounds based on the weather, and a .catch so if there is an error you will know. CSS is used to generally style and allign the page, create the the animation on load in, create the growing text box on focus, and the button animation and growth upon mouse hover, and change color on active for the button.

I faced a lot of challenges with this project, some of the most notable were getting all of my grid elements to be properly aligned and having the webpage be more dynamic and eye catching though animation and transformations.

In the future I look to implement more data being displayed upon search, and a forecast tab as well.

To install and run the project. You will need to download the files as well as the images folder, get a free API key from openweathermap.org, and in the index.js file, paste the API key to line 11 inside the variable. Everything should run smooth after that.
